# Pepper - Discord Bot 
---
Pepper is a discrod bot that comforts you with something inspirational or somethign heartwarming when you're feeling down. 
##What's new?
---
I added slash commands to Pepper instead of command prefixes. The benefit of this is it's much easier for users to access Pepepr's commands and can see every command Pepper can do when they type slash "/".
## Features
1. It recognizes keywords like `"sad"`, `"depressed"`,`"unhappy"` etc. and responds with a random text from its files to cheer you up.
2. It detects swear words and warns anyone who swears.
3. It can count the number of members in the user's server.
4. It can send memes from reddit using a Reddit API.
5. It can play rock, paper, scissors with the user.

##Future Iterations:
---
In the future, Pepper can do more such as tell the weather, get the price of stocks etc.
